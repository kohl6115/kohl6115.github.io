        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that is a role model for others. A hero is someone that does the right thing even if it is frowned upon by others, or even when no one is looking.</p>
        <p>Willie Mays has left an amazing impact on the game of baseball for generations to come. Not only by how great of an athlete he was, but in the way he was able to carry himself as a person on and off the field. He was an extrodinary role model to all athletes, and was a prime example of hard work while enjoying life itself.</p>
